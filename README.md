## Day 1 Progress - Data Loading
1- Created "House Price Prediction" Project Repo.
2- Addes Dataset.
3- Loaded Dataset in jupyter notebook.
4- Checked basic informations like info() , shape , first rows.

## Day 2 Progress - Dealing with Missing Values
1- Performed EDA.
2- Checked missing values.
3- Visualized target distribution.
4- Generated heatmap, boxplots, countplots.
5- Documented observations.

## Day 3 Progress - Feature Engineering
1- Filled Missing Values(median for numbers, mode for categories).
2- Converted categorical variables into numerical (One-Hot Encoding).
3- Transformed target Rent using log.
4- Scaled numerical features for ML.
5- Saved final processed dataset.

## Day 4 progress - Model Building
1- Imported Some libraries.
2- Define target and features.
3- Split train/test.
4- Building Base line Models.
5- Evaluation

## Day 5 Progress - Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross Validation
1- Linear Regression: applied 5-fold cross validation
2- Decision Tree: tuned hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf)
3- Random Forest: tuned hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split)
4- Compared performances â†’ Random Forest performed best after tuning
5- Saved best models for future use
